Description: This package implements the computation of network science statistics
    on (rooted or unrooted) phylogenetic trees in linear time. The statistics include
    diameter, mean path length, degree assortativity, and three node-based centrality
    values: betweenness centrality, closeness centrality, and eigenvector centrality.
    These statistics, useful for distinguishing evolutionary scenarios, are computed 
    in time and space linear in the tree size, and can take branch length into account.  
    In addition, this package can compute the spectra of the adjacency, Laplacian, and
    distance matrices, although this computation may be cubic in the tree size. The 
    methods are described in “Network science inspires novel tree shape statistics”.
